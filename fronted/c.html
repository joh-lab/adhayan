    <h2>C Introduction</h2>
    <p> C <strong>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.</strong>, It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
     C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
        </p>

    <h3>Basic Syntax of C </h3>
    <p>You have already seen the following code a couple of times in the first chapters. Let's break it down to understand it better:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
    #include<stdio.h>

     int main() 
    {
      printf("Hello World!");
      return 0;
     }</code>
    </pre>

    <p><strong>Why Learn C?</strong></p>
    <p>It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world</p>
    <p>If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar</p>
    <p> C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python</p>
    <p> C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies
     </p>
         </ul>

    <h1><strong> C Elements</strong></h1>
    <p>Summary of Key C Elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variables and Data Types:-</strong> Declare variables and assign appropriate data types (e.g., int, char, float).</li>
        <li><strong>Operators:-</strong>Perform arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Flow:-</strong>Use if, else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while) to control the execution of the program.</li>
        <li><strong>Functions:-</strong> Modularize code into reusable blocks. </li>
        <li><strong>Arrays:-</strong> Store multiple values of the same type.</li>
        <li><strong>Pointers:-</strong>Work with memory addresses directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Structures:-</strong>Group related data types together.</li>
        <li><strong>File I/O:-</strong>Handle reading from and writing to files.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:-</strong>Dynamically allocate and free memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Preprocessor Directives:-</strong> Direct the preprocessor to include files, define constants, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>C Example: A Simple hello world program</h2>
    <pre>
<code> #include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor directive to include standard I/O functions
 int main()
{
 // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
 printf("Hello, World!\n");
 return 0;  // Indicate that the program finished successfully
 }   
</code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Explanation of the Program:</h3>
    <p>#include <stdio.h>: This is a preprocessor directive that includes the standard input-output library in C. It allows us to use functions like printf() for displaying output. </p>
    <p>int main(): This is the main function where the execution of the program starts. The int means that the function returns an integer value (usually 0 for successful execution).</p>
    <p>printf("Hello, World!\n");: This function prints the text Hello, World! followed by a newline (\n) on the screen.
    <p>return 0;: This indicates the successful completion of the program. The 0 is returned to the operating system to show that there were no errors during execution.</p>

    </p>
    <h3>How to Compile and Run:</h3>
    <p>1.Save the program in a file, for example, hello.c.</p>
    <p>2.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
    <p>3.Compile the program using a C compiler: </p>
    <p>gcc hello.c -o hello</p>
    <p>4.Run the compiled program:</p>
    <p>./hello </p>
    <h2>Output:
    Hello, World!
    </h2>
